    "<p>Although you can view a notebook as a static document (GitHub, for example has a built-in\r\n",
    "static notebook renderer), if you want to run the code in a notebook, the notebook\r\n",
    "must be attached to a backend process, know as a Jupyter kernel. The kernel\r\n",
    "is really where your code is being run and where all of variables and objects\r\n",
    "created in the code are held. The browser is just the viewer for this data.\r\n",
