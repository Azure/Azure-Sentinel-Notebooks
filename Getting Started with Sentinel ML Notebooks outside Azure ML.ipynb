    "## Choosing a notebook environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main options and a few other (untested) options\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local Jupyter  install - this involves installing and running Python and Jupyter on your local machine\n",
    "- Docker - this is still a local option but the Python and Juptyer code are pre-configured and run in a container.\n",
    "- Remote Jupyter hub - this is more appropriate for shared notebook working. With this option you install Jupyter Hub on a host or virtual machine then access it locally using one of the Jupyter clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options that you may want to consider and test are using another notebook provider such as Google CoLab or Amazon Sagemaker. We have not tested the use of MSTICPy or notebooks accessing MS Sentinel in these environments though.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing a notebook client\n",
    "There are several options available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter classic - this is the original Jupyter client and, although no longer officially supported by the Jupyter team, is still in widespread use and has a lot of community support.\n",
    "- Jupyter lab is the evolution of Jupyter and has more advanced and user-friendly interface (such as multi-tabbed notebooks, variable explorer) as well as having a more solid and more secure extension framework than  Jupyter classic.\n",
    "- Visual Studio code - has a great notebook experience with similar capabilities to Jupyter lab.\n",
    "- PyCharm, another code editing environment also has good notebook support\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these clients have a rich ecosystem of extensions that can add capabilities\n",
    "such as code formatting, spell checking, code snippets, version control and code\n",
    "debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "One minor downside with both VSCode and PyCharm is that they are primarily aimed at developers, so the look and feel may be a little intimidating at first for non-developers.\n",
    "However, they also bring capabilities such as advance debugging, object/variable\n",
    "inspect as well more capabilities for developing related code such as Python\n",
    "libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook clients listed above are not specific to any notebook\n",
    "environment and you can freely switch between them. Some notebook enviroments such\n",
    "as Azure ML, Azure Data Explorer, Google CoLab and Amazon Sagemaker also have\n",
    "their own notebook clients that may bring additional features.\n",
