    "<b>Python Version:</b> Python 3.6<br>\n",
    "<b>Data Sources Required:</b> MDE SecurityAlert, W3CIIS Log (or similar web logging)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This notebook investigates Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) webshell alerts. The notebook will guide you through steps to collect MDE alerts for webshell activity and link them to server access logs to identify potential attackers.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Configuration Required!</b></p>\n",
    "<p>This Notebook presumes you have Azure Sentinel Workspace settings configured in a config file. If you do not have this in place please <a href =\"https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/msticpyconfig.html#\">read the docs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks/blob/master/ConfiguringNotebookEnvironment.ipynb\">use this notebook</a> to test.</p>\n",
    "<h2>How to use:</h2>\n",
    "<p>This notebook provides a step-by-step investigation to understand MDE webshell alerts on your server. While our example uses IIS logging this notebook can be converted to support any web log type.</p>\n",
    "<p>After congiuration you can investigate two scenarios, a webshell file alert or a webshell command execution alert. For each of these we will need to retrieve different data, the notebook contains branching execution at Step 3 to enable this.</p>\n",
    "<p>Below you'll find a more detailed description of the two types of investigation</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <h4><u>Shell File Alert</u></h4>\n",
    "    <p>This alert type will fire when a file that is suspected to be a webshell appears on disk. For this investigation we will start with a known filename that is a suspected shell (e.g. Setconfigure.aspx) and we will try to understand how this webshell was placed on the server.</p>\n",
    "    <h4><u>Shell Command Execution Alert</u></h4>\n",
    "    <p>This alert type will fire when a command is executed on your web server that is suspicious. For this investigation we start with the command line that was executed and the time window that execution took place.</p>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><b>For both of the above alert types this notebook will allow you to find the following information:</b></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The attacker IP</li>\n",
    "    <li>The attacker User Agent</li>\n",
    "    <li>The website name the attacker interacted with</li>\n",
    "    <li>The location of the shell on your server</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Once we have that information this notebook will allow you to investigate the attacker IP, User Agent or both to discover:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The files the attacker accessed prior to the installation of the shell</li>\n",
    "    <li>The first time the attacker accessed your server</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
