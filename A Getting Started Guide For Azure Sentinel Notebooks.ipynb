      "You are currently reading a Jupyter notebook. [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is an interactive development and data manipulation environment presented in a browser. Using Jupyter you can create documents, called Notebooks. These documents are made up of cells that contain interactive code, alongside that code's output, and other items such as text and images (what you are looking at now is a cell of Markdown text).\n",
      "\n",
      "The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. Whilst you can use any of these languages we are going to use Python in this notebook, in addition the notebooks that come with Microsoft Sentinel are all written in Python. Whilst there are pros, and cons to each language Python is a well-established language that has a large number of materials and libraries well suited for data analysis and security investigation, making it ideal for our needs.\n",

      "## How to use a Jupyter notebook?\n",
      "To use a Jupyter notebook you need a Jupyter server that will render the notebook and execute the code within it. This can take the form of a local [Jupyter installation](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/), or a remotely hosted version such as [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/). If you are reading this it is highly likely that you already have a Jupyter server that this notebook is using.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Using Azure Notebooks\n",
      "If you accessed this notebook from Microsoft Sentinel,  you are probably using Azure Notebooks to run this notebook. Azure Notebooks runs in the same way that a local Jupyter server with, except with the additional feature of integrated project management and file storage. When you open a notebook in Azure Notebooks the user interface is nearly identical to a standard Jupyter notebook experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you can start running code in a notebook you need to make sure that it is connected to a Jupyter server and you have the correct type of kernel configured. For this notebook we are going to be using Python 3.6, hopefully Azure Notebooks has already loaded this kernel for you - you can check this by looking at the top left corner of the screen where you should see the currently connected kernel. \n",

      "> **Tip**: You can identify which cells are code by selecting them and looking at the drop down box at the center of the top menu. It will either read 'Code' (for interactive code cells), 'Markdown' (for Markdown text cells like this one), or RawNBConvert (these are just raw data and not interpreted by Jupyter - they can be used by tools that process notebook files, such as *nbconvert* to render the data into HTML or LaTeX). \n",
