        "## Description\n",
        "This guided hunting notebook leverages machine learning to tackle the difficult problem of detecting low and slow password spray campaigns (This augments more broad-scoped password spray detection already provided via Microsoft’s Identity Protection Integration for Sentinel.)\n",
        "We leverage the built-in parallelism of PySpark and MLlib (via the Azure Synapse linked service) to ingest, query and analyse data at scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low and slow sprays are a variant on traditional password spray attacks that are being increasingly used by sophisticated adversaries.\n",
        "These adversaries can randomize client fields between each sign in attempt, including IP addresses, user agents and client application and are often willing to let the password spray campaigns run at a very low frequency over a period of months or years, making detection very challenging.  \n",
        "A key observation that we exploit in this noteboo is the fact that, within a single campaign, attackers often randomize the same large number of properties simultaneously, resulting in a group of logins occurring periodically over a long period of time with same set of anomalous properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook runs through the following ML-driven approach to surfacing potential low and slow sprays. (For more details on the approach see the accompanying Microsoft Tech Community blog post: [Microsoft Sentinel Blog - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/bg-p/MicrosoftSentinelBlog).)\n",

        "1.\t**Detect anomalous fields for each failed sign-in** attempt using successful sign-ins as a baseline\n",
        "2.\t**Use ML to cluster failed sign-ins** by the columns which were randomized/anomalous\n",
        "3.\t**Prune the clusters** from the previous step based on knowledge of what a low and slow spray looks like; for example, by removing clusters in which sign-ins do not occur at a steady frequency over an extended period of time\n",
        "4.\t**Further analyze the candidate password spray clusters** (using threat intelligence enrichments from msticpy, for example), to find any invariant properties within the clusters\n",
        "5.\t**Identify any successful sign-ins that follow the patterns** observed for each cluster from the previous step and create Sentinel incidents as appropriate\n",

        "## Overview of ML Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Our novel ML approach begins with the observation that attackers often randomize the same large number of properties simultaneously, resulting in a group of logins occurring periodically over a long period of time with same set of anomalous properties. \n",
        "Thus, we can attempt to cluster failed sign-ins (most password spray sign-in attempts will fail!) based on the set of properties that are anomalous.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "We use a naive Bayes approach to estimate the likelihood of any given peroperty value ocurring for a legitimate sign-in and then use outlier detection to highlight unlikely values as being \"anomalous\". This gives a dataset in which the rows comprise a (failed) sign-in ID and boolean flags for each sign-in property denoting whether or not that property took an anomalous value. \n",
        "We model this scenario as a multivariate Bernoulli mixture model, and perform [variational Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods) to detect the presence of latent classes which will be our candidates for low and slow password spray campaigns. \n",
        "Later, we filter these candidate low and slow clusters by computing various statistics (such as the uniformity of the time-distribution of the sign-ins) and comparing these against what we would expect from a low and slow password spray.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more details, see the accompanying Microsoft Tech Community blog post: [Microsoft Sentinel Blog - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/bg-p/MicrosoftSentinelBlog).)\n",
        "\n",
        "The overall approach looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\t**Detect anomalous fields for each failed sign-in** attempt using successful sign-ins as a baseline\n",
        "2.\t**Cluster failed sign-ins** by the columns which were randomized/anomalous\n",
        "3.\t**Prune the clusters** from the previous step based on knowledge of what a low and slow spray looks like; for example, by removing clusters in which sign-ins do not occur at a steady frequency over an extended period of time\n",
        "4.\t**Further analyze the candidate password spray clusters** (using threat intelligence enrichments from msticpy, for example), to find any invariant properties within the clusters\n",
        "5.\t**Identify any successful sign-ins that follow the patterns** observed for each cluster from the previous step and create Sentinel incidents as appropriate"
