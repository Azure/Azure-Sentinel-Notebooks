Using Jupyter you can create documents, called Notebooks. These documents are made up of cells that contain interactive code, alongside that code's output, and other items such as text and images (what you are looking at now is a cell of Markdown text).\n",
        "\n",
        "The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. Whilst you can use any of these languages we are going to use Python in this notebook, in addition the notebooks that come with Microsoft Sentinel are all written in Python. Whilst there are pros, and cons to each language Python is a well-established language that has a large number of materials and libraries well suited for data analysis and security investigation, making it ideal for our needs.\n",

This can take the form of a local [Jupyter installation](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/), or a remotely hosted version such as [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/). If you are reading this it is highly likely that you already have a Jupyter server that this notebook is using.\n",

When you open a notebook in Azure Notebooks the user interface is nearly identical to a standard Jupyter notebook experience.\n",

        "Before you can start running code in a notebook you need to make sure that it is connected to a Jupyter server and you have the correct type of kernel configured. For this notebook we are going to be using Python 3.6, hopefully Azure Notebooks has already loaded this kernel for you - you can check this by looking at the top left corner of the screen where you should see the currently connected kernel. \n",

It will either read 'Code' (for interactive code cells), 'Markdown' (for Markdown text cells like this one), or RawNBConvert (these are just raw data and not interpreted by Jupyter - they can be used by tools that process notebook files, such as *nbconvert* to render the data into HTML or LaTeX). \n",

        "This notebook has showed you the basics of using notebooks and Microsoft Sentinel for security investigaitons. There are many more things possible using notebooks and it is stronly encouraged to read the material we have referenced in the learn more sections in this notebook. You can also explore the other Microsoft Sentinel notebooks in order to take advantage of the pre-built hunting logic, and understand other analysis techniques that are possible. </br>\n",
