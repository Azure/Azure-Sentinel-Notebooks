Jupyter notebooks are an interactive development and data analysis
environment hosted in a browser. The open API supported by Microsoft Sentinel
allows you to use Jupyter notebooks to query, transform, analyze
and visualize Microsoft Sentinel data. This makes notebooks a powerful
addition to Microsoft Sentinel and is especially well-suited to ad-hoc
investigations, hunting or customized workflows.

[Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/notebooks)

This repository contains notebooks contributed by Microsoft and the community
to assist hunting and investigation tasks in Microsoft Sentinel.

The notebooks are mostly one of several types:

- Exploration notebooks. These are meant to be used as they are or with
  your own customizations to explore specific hunting and investigation
  scenarios. Examples of this type include the Entity explorer series.
  (“Entity” refers to items such as hosts, IP addresses, accounts, URLs, etc.)
- Guided hunting and guided investigation notebooks that follow a specific
  CyberSec scenario
- How-To notebooks like the Get Started and ConfigureNotebookEnvironment notebooks.
- Sample notebooks. These are longer and are meant to be instructional
  examples following a real or simulated hunt or investigation. They typically
  have save sample data so that you can see what they are meant to do.
